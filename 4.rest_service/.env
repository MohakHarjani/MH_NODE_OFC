 # Using environmental values allows one to configure values in 
 # a software/application from outside the software/application itself. 
 # This ensures that one doesnâ€™t have to store sensitive data in the code itself. 
 # It also helps in reconfiguring the settings in an application without 
 # redeploying it.
